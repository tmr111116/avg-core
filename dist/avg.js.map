It enables us to name arguments positionally, e.g., if the second argument is a\n  non-alphanumeric terminal like \"+\", it will be named '$2'.\n\n  `noDupCheck` is true if the caller of `toArgumentNameList` is not a top level caller. It enables\n  us to avoid nested duplication subscripts appending, e.g., '_1_1', '_1_2', by only checking\n  duplicates at the top level.\n\n  Here is a more elaborate example that illustrates how this method works:\n  `(a \"+\" b).toArgumentNameList(1)` evaluates to `['a', '$2', 'b']` with the following recursive\n  calls:\n\n    (a).toArgumentNameList(1) -> ['a'],\n    (\"+\").toArgumentNameList(2) -> ['$2'],\n    (b).toArgumentNameList(3) -> ['b']\n\n  Notes:\n  * This method must only be called on well-formed expressions, e.g., the receiver must\n    not have any Alt sub-expressions with inconsistent arities.\n  * e.getArity() === e.toArgumentNameList(1).length\n*/\n// function(firstArgIndex, noDupCheck) { ... }\npexprs.PExpr.prototype.toArgumentNameList = common.abstract('toArgumentNameList');\n\npexprs.any.toArgumentNameList = function(firstArgIndex, noDupCheck) {\n  return ['any'];\n};\n\npexprs.end.toArgumentNameList = function(firstArgIndex, noDupCheck) {\n  return ['end'];\n};\n\npexprs.Terminal.prototype.toArgumentNameList = function(firstArgIndex, noDupCheck) {\n  if (typeof this.obj === 'string' && /^[_a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(this.obj)) {\n    // If this terminal is a valid suffix for a JS identifier, just prepend it with '_'\n    return ['_' + this.obj];\n  } else {\n    // Otherwise, name it positionally.\n    return ['$' + firstArgIndex];\n  }\n};\n\npexprs.Range.prototype.toArgumentNameList = function(firstArgIndex, noDupCheck) {\n  var argName = this.from + '_to_' + this.to;\n  // If the `argName` is not valid then try to prepend a `_`.\n  if (!isRestrictedJSIdentifier(argName)) {\n    argName = '_' + argName;\n  }\n  // If the `argName` still not valid after prepending a `_`, then name it positionally.\n  if (!isRestrictedJSIdentifier(argName)) {\n    argName = '$' + firstArgIndex;\n  }\n  return [argName];\n};\n\npexprs.Alt.prototype.toArgumentNameList = function(firstArgIndex, noDupCheck) {\n  // `termArgNameLists` is an array of arrays where each row is the\n  // argument name list that corresponds to a term in this alternation.\n  var termArgNameLists = this.terms.map(function(term) {\n    return term.toArgumentNameList(firstArgIndex, true);\n  });\n\n  var argumentNameList = [];\n  var numArgs = termArgNameLists[0].length;\n  for (var colIdx = 0;
